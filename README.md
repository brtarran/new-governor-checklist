# Onboarding checklist for new primary school governors in the UK
A simple web app, developed using Google Gemini, to support onboarding of new primary school governors.

The app was developed following the June 2025 [Harlow Inspirational Learning Trust](https://www.hiltacademies.org/) Governors' Day. 

It aims to provide a structured series of tasks for new governors to complete over the first 6 months of their role. In completing these tasks, governors will gain a better understanding of their role and responsibilities as well as the school(s) they are supporting. 

A secondary aim is to encourage governors to engage in self-directed learning and continuous professional development, with a manageable time commitment of around 1-2 hours per week, which should continue throughout their term of office.

## How the app works
The app is designed to run in a web browser. User data will be stored in the browser's local storage, so no server is required. Governors can access the app from any device with a web browser, making it easy to use on the go. However, checklist progress will not be synced across devices, so governors should use the app on a single device for consistency. They should also avoid clearing their browser's local storage, as this will reset their progress.

## Can I use the app for my school or trust?
Yes, the app is open source and can be used by any school or trust. Fork the main branch of this repository to create your own version of the app. You can then customise logos, colours, text, tasks and resources to suit the needs of your school or trust.

If you need help with customisation or deployment, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/brtarran/new-governor-checklist/issues) in this repository.
